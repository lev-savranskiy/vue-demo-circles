# Vue.js  Sphere App

## Project

npm package `calcSphere` with the necessary code.

Allow users to make a list of points that lay inside the sphere. 

They should be able to create a new group that identifies the radius of circle. 

Then they will add points to this group and the app will tell them which ones are suitable.
 
Users can save or delete the point.

If they save, the point must be in the group after a page reload. 
 
 The group should be able to be saved, deleted, or edited.

## Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
